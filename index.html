                            Like bushfire in harmattan, what started off as teenagers mimicking American ‘gangster’
                            lifestyle has gone viral; turning into a wild identity craze that has gained
                            international recognition. The word Kumerica is an amalgamation of the two words, Kumasi
                            and America. Kumasi, where the craze started, is the capital of the Ashanti Region of
                            Ghana; a place noted for its rich tradition and status as the seat of Asantehene – ruler
                            of the Ashanti Kingdom.
                            <br>
                            Essentially, Kumerica seeks to reflect the similarities that exist between Kumasi and
                            urban American neighbourhoods. As a result, there are now towns in Kumasi with American
                            names albeit unofficial. Abrepo is now Georgia, Atonsu is Mississipi, Krofrom is Ohio,
                            Bantama is Florida and the statue of Komfo Anokye is now cultural equivalent of the
                            Statue of Liberty in America.
                            <br>
                            Following the growing trend, a group of upcoming artistes have released hard-core
                            hip-hop songs that have hurled them into Ghanaian music spotlight. These artistes
                            combine various hip-hop influences, most notably, drill; a rap style that focuses on
                            focuses on hustle, crime and the daily ordeals of life on the streets instead of
                            metaphors and wordplay. Thanks to the power of social media, some of these artistes have
                            gained international recognition. A project by O’kenneth and Reggie, Straight Outta
                            Kumerica, an apparent reference to the (in)famous Straight Outta Compton album by N.W.A
                            was recently recognized by Spotify. The popular streaming platform, Audiomack, also
                            published a playlist ‘This Is Kumerica’ calling it a celebration of a bubbling Ghanaian
                            music scene.
                            <br>

                            Another kumerica-inspired song, SORE, by Yaw Tog, Kenneth, City Boy, Reggie and JayBahd
                            has gained popular acclaim drawing the attention of Vic Mensa, the prolific American
                            rapper of Ghanaian heritage signed to Jay-Z’s label Roc Nation.
                            <br>
                            Nonetheless, Ghanaians are divided on the Kumerica craze. While a section of the
                            population considers the movement a creative vehicle that conveys the life of young
                            Ghanaians influenced by hip-hop, others complain that the occult imitation to American
                            lifestyle is unpleasantly unoriginal.

                            World-renowned British-Ghanaian Architect, Sir David Adjaye OBE has received the highest
                            professional honour in the United Kingdom - the Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of
                            British Architects. He is the first black recipient of the prestigious award and has
                            therefore registered his hope that his achievement would "break the ceiling" for more
                            black creators.
                            <br>
                            Sir Adjaye, who was knighted in 2017 by Queen Elizabeth II, is, without doubt, one of
                            the most celebrated black designers today. He was recognized in the same year as one of
                            the 100 most influential people by TIME Magazine as has been touted globally as one of
                            the leading architects of this generation. <br>

                            His firm, Adjaye Associates, which today operates globally, with studios in Accra,
                            London, and New York is responsible for several monumental projects across the world.
                            His largest project to date, The National Museum of African American History & Culture
                            in Washington, DC opened on the National Mall in Washington DC in 2016 and was named
                            Cultural Event of the Year by The New York Times. He also spearheaded the creation of
                            Webster’s flagship store in Los Angeles, Moscow School of Management, SKOLKOVO, Russia
                            as well as the Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi UAE; a symbolic project of peaceful
                            co-existence comprising a collection of three religious spaces: a mosque, a synagogue
                            and a church. He is also the architect in charge of the controversial National Cathedral
                            in Ghana. <br>

                            Addressing the significance of his award in an interview with BBC's Focus on Africa
                            radio show, Sir Adjaye explained that the award is important not just for him but for
                            all black designers who often excluded from awards. <br>

                            "I hope this allows more and more black designers to be celebrated," he added. <br>

                            If you have plans of visiting Hawaii, Spain or Japan, chances are high that you would
                            rehearse to polish your Aloha, Gracias and Konnichiwa respectively. Of course, that's a

                            If you find yourself in Ghana, the word Chale will come at you thick and fast. However,

                            Chale, we could have explained the many instances to you but here's an excellent

                            Afrobeats as a genre of music was originally originated from Ghana. However, it is
                            mainly accredited to Nigerian music legend Fela Kuti. this is because in the late
                            sixties he started making afrobeat music and took it to the world stage.

                            <b>Yet, how did everything start?</b> Even though he had been making and playing music
                            before at that point, Fela wasn't making music in the Afrobeat style and didn't coin the
                            expression "Afrobeat" until after his fundamental outing to the U.S.A in 1969, during
                            which he was acquainted with the works of activists like Martin Luther King and Malcolm
                            X, which stirred his social and political awareness. Supported by his wide melodic
                            presentation which incorporates Soul, Jazz, Funk, Highlife, and other African sorts,
                            Fela chose to build up another melodic style and development that would mirror his
                            melodic ability, advance the African culture and empower him to share his message of
                            social equity, opportunity, and Pan-Africanism with the world.
                            <br> The Afrobeat type, even though a combination of numerous different styles, is so
                            remarkable and obvious that it keeps on establishing a connection with your brain long
                            after you have tuned in to it. Artist and BBC DJ, Katrina Leskanich depicts it along
                            these lines: "take the improvisational character of jazz, join it with the raunchiness
                            of funk, flavor the blend with African convention and add a political message to it.
                            What do you end up with? An Afrobeat record. <br>
                            <br> The following are instruments that are needed to create an afrobeat music

                            To this day Fela Kuti’s afrobeats still exist and are still being played. Though current
                            forms of it have added blends from other sounds. His sons Seun and Femi Kuti still carry
                            out his message and legacy. <br><br>
                            <b>The influence of Afrobeats on today's world and music is simply immense and

                            Beyond Fela’s reign, Afro-beats has had its influence around the world. It has attracted
                            several legendary jazz musicians such as Roy Ayers in 1970 and Randy Weston in 1990. It
                            has resulted in albums such as Africa: the center of the world by Roy Ayers. <br>
                            Branford Marsalis in 1994, an American saxophonist included 
                            Fela’s “Beast of no nations” in his Buckshot LeFonque album. 
                            In 2009 the music label Knitting Factory Records (KFR) created the Broadway musical
                            FELA! As said on the melodic's site, the story displayed Fela Kuti's "fortitude and
                            mind-boggling melodic dominance" alongside the story of his life. The show had 11 Tony
                            nominations, getting three for Best Costumes, Best Sound, and Best Choreography. FELA!
                            Was on Broadway for a very long time and was delivered by notables, for example, Shawn
                            "Jay-Z" Carter and Will and Jada Pinkett-Smith. Numerous famous people were noted on
                            going to the shows, for example, Denzel Washington, Madonna, Sting, Spike Lee (who saw
                            it multiple times), Kofi Annan, and even Michelle Obama. Michelle Williams, the previous
                            vocalist of young lady bunch Destiny's Child, was given a role as the function of Sandra
                            Isadore. <br> <br>
                            Famous musicians like Jay-Z, Drake, J. Cole, Paul Simon, Nas, Missy Elliot, Brian Eno,
                            David Byrne, and Peter Gabriel have all utilized obvious Afrobeat components in their
                            music, as have more present-day groups, for example, Vampire Weekend. Fela Kuti himself
                            may be the most name-dropped non-rapper in hip-hop history, and his melodies keep on
                            being inspected by makers, MCs, and DJs. Outstanding figures like The Roots and Lupe
                            Fiasco have composed entire melodies about him, and still, others refer to him as an
                            impact. Afro-beats have indeed influenced today's music. <br>

                            What started as a minor infection in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has turned into one
                            of the most devastating viruses ever to hit the world. Having killed over 36 million
                            people around the world, it was declared a pandemic on 11th March 2020. Despite the
                            havoc it has wrecked on the global frontier, COVID 19 has seemed to have fewer effects
                            in Africa as a whole. The percentage of lives lost to this virus in Africa is one of the
                            least around the globe, despite being one of the least affected continents, Africa has
                            had its share of the COVID 19 menace. Several aspects of the African economy have been
                            completely shut down. <br>

                            The harsh effects of this virus on the African economy stems from the fact there is
                            <strong>Inadequate number of testing kits and isolations centers</strong>, there's no
                            denying the fact that most African countries lack the appropriate testing kits and
                            proper isolation centers for detection and prevention of the virus. This has majorly
                            increased the rate of infection and death among the African countries. This has resulted
                            in immense negative impacts on the ever-vibrant continent. <br><br><br>

                            First and foremost, and perhaps the harshest hit part of the economies in the African
                            continent is the shutdown of the tourism sector. Since the virus is transferred through
                            human contact, during the peak of the virus every country closed its border to
                            foreigners, and hence movement from one country to another was cut off. This resulted in
                            the shutting down of the tourist attractions and the tourism sector. In Ghana and
                            Nigeria, tourism contributes roughly to about 40 percent of the countries revenue per
                            year. So all the revenue the countries could have accrued from tourism in 2020 has been
                            cut half or even completely lost, this thereby decreases the country's total revenue
                            income at the end of the year and thereby reduces the per capita income at the end of
                            the year. <br><br>
                            <br>
                            <h4>Unemployment</h4><br>
                            The COVID 19 has reared the ugly head of the canker in every nation's economy,
                            Unemployment. By the first three months of the year, 30% of the South African country
                            became unemployed. That amounts to 7 million people. Unemployment brings about the
                            situation whereby active people who are ready and willing to work are denied jobs. This
                            happens mostly because companies can no longer afford to
                            <figure>
                                <img src="<?=PROOT?>assets/images/covid3.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid" />

                            pay the wages of these workers. This has become profoundly serious to the extent that
                            Pandemic unemployment assistance aids and several unemployment aids have been set up to
                            reduce the effects of the virus. Due to unemployment, able-bodied people can no longer
                            work to bring in revenue and pay taxes that can generate income. That could be used to
                            engage in economic activities that will boost the economy. <br>
                            Unemployment as an effect of the coronavirus has not only affected the economy in Africa
                            but has increased the surge of crime. This is because people have no work to do to
                            maintain themselves, so they resort to crime as a means of survival.

                            <h5>Shocks in supply and demand cycles</h5><br>
                            <img src="<?=PROOT?>assets/images/covid4.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid" />
                            <br>
                            In 2019, Africa’s GDP increase at 3.6% was ‘even’ inadequate to speed up financial and
                            social growth and decrease poverty. Growth per capita used to be around 0.7% and job
                            introduction had no longer saved pace with the want to furnish possibilities to the 29
                            million younger human beings coming into working age every year. Since 2000, <b>Africa’s
                                GDP boom has mostly been pushed by using home demand (69% of the total)</b>.
                            Africa’s labor productiveness as a share of the US stage stagnated between 2000 and
                            2018, and the Africa-to-Asia labor productiveness ratio has diminished from 67% in 2000
                            to 50% nowadays (AUC/OECD, 2019[3]). Global markets account for 88% of Africa’s exports,
                            ordinarily in oil, mineral assets, and agricultural commodities. <br>
                             At the onset of the COVID 19 crisis, potentialities differed throughout economies. Some
                            have been exhibiting excessive growth-rates, in extra of 7.5% (Rwanda, Côte d’Ivoire,
                            and Ethiopia), however, Africa’s biggest economies had slowed down. In Nigeria (GDP boom
                            of 2.3%), the non-oil area has been sluggish, in Angola (-0.3%) the oil area remained
                            weak, whilst in South Africa (0.9%) low funding sentiment weighed on financial activity.
                            Due to the shocking surge in demand followed by a deep sink or up-rise in supply has
                            affected the economy because there is no way of predicting a surge or downfall of a good
                            or product. Thereby companies may provide a high supply of a good or service and end up
                            running at loss due to shock changes in the demand and supply cycles. <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h4>Trade</h4><br>
                            As if the issue of shocks in the supply and demand cycle is not enough, just as
                            painfully expected COVID 19 has hit trade in African economies extremely hard. The first
                            five months of the virus’s hit were recorded as one of the worst trade periods for
                            Africa because they relied on export commodities whose prices have crashed badly on the
                            world stage. <br>
                            According to the World Bank report, because of the pandemic, economic growth in
                            sub-Saharan Africa has decreased by 2.4% in 2019 to between -2.1% and -5.1% in 2020.
                            This is the first time this region has experienced such a recession in 25 years. This
                            will inevitably affect Africa’s participation in trade and value chains as well as
                            reduce foreign financing flows. This just but a few impacts of COVID 19 on the African
                            economy. <br><br><br>
                            <h4>Conclusion</h4><br>
                            In conclusion, the harsh impacts of COVID 19 have negatively affected the African
                            economy and some steps are been taken to hopefully recover from the impacts and prepare
                            in case of any other surprise occurrence. Firstly,
                            <b>Governments of the most countries in Africa have decided to diversify the
                                economy:</b>
                            the virus has shown the overdependence of the countries on traditional economic ventures
                            such as tourism, trade, and production of primary products, and now other ventures are
                            being looked into to diversify the economies of these countries. <br>
                            Also, <b>Africa will need more favorable international trade agreements to support its
                                growing but still fragile export sector.</b>br
                            Just as Martin Luther King said, “If you can't fly then run if you can't run then walk
                            if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” With
                            new visions and ideas assisted with faith, Africa can hopefully recover from the effects
                            of this destructive virus and bring back the dying economies to life. <br>

                            The Covid 19 also known as the coronavirus was first confirmed in china and since then
                            it has spread across all countries on the planet. <b>The first three cases were
                                confirmed in march 2020 in Madagascar and all the patients were women.</b><br><br>
                            By April 2020, 121 cases were discovered but yet no death cases. There were 71 new
                            people infected. The infection rate however decreased by 37% as compared to March.
                            <br><br>
                            On May 16th, 2020, Madagascar confirmed its first death case associated with the covid
                            19. It was a 54-year-old medical worker who suffered from diabetes and high blood
                            pressure. As of June 2020, the European center for disease prevention and control had
                            confirmed 6 more covid 19 related deaths. <br><br>
                            By July 2020 cases saw a drastic surge as cases surged to up to 8654 new cases and the
                            death toll increased to 106. This called for an emergency nation-wide lockdown. <br><br>
                            By September 2020 there were 1,514 fresh cases, bringing the absolute number of affirmed
                            cases to 16,377. The loss of life rose to 229. The quantity of recouped patients
                            expanded to 15,139, leaving 1,009 active cases toward the finish of the month. <br><br>

                            COVID-19. <br><br>

                            On 20 April 2020, Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina authoritatively dispatched a
                            Covid "cure" named "Coronavirus Organic". Created by the Madagascar Institute of Applied
                            Research (MIAR), the natural tea was made utilizing artemisia and other privately
                            sourced spices. Military personnel was dispatched to distribute batches of "Coronavirus
                            Organic", with Colonel Willy Ratovondrainy declaring on state TV that the tea would
                            "reinforce immunity".[27] However, the National Academy of Medicine of Madagascar
                            (ANAMEM) voiced its wariness, while the World Health Organization (WHO) forewarned that
                            there was no confirmation for any Covid fix at the hour of Covid-Organic's dispatch. The
                            African Union has gone into conversations with the Malagasy government to test the
                            medication's security and productivity. Although the ‘cure’ has not proved to be
                            effective, it’s a step towards remedy and the lockdown is helping to slow down the rate
                            of infection.

                            On the 20th of October 2011, the world was stunned by the news that the dictator of
                            Libya has been killed. Muammar Gaddafi and his cohorts were caught hiding in drainage
                            pipes after fleeing from attack. It was an end to a horrific reign of terror, but one
                            may ask was that the end Gaddafi deserved? <br>

                            <img src="<?=PROOT?>assets/images/covidma3.jpg" alt="Gaddafi"
                                class="img-fluid art-img" /><br><br>


                            He had led an autocratic Libya for 42 years and squashed any other political power while
                            maintaining total dictatorship over the country and He allegedly funded international
                            terrorism. Gaddafi was also known for killing many people he deemed were his enemies and
                            labeling his own people “rats” and executing them and injuring a thousand others in the
                            process. <br><br>
                            Yet there are two simple questions to ask: <b>Has Gaddafi’s death made Libya better? Is
                                Libya happy now?</b><br><br>
                            To answer these questions we need to go back exactly ten (10) years back to Libya during
                            the peak of Gaddafi’s rule and compare it with present day Libya. <br><br><br>
                            <b>Gaddafi carried out the world’s largest irrigation project</b><br><br>
                            By now you would have already known of how hot and dry some parts of Africa is,
                            especially the parts that have Desert. Farming in those parts was a problem and a
                            headache and access to potable water were much of an imagination. The Gaddafi system
                            left on one of present-day man's structures of improvement: the Great Man-Made River
                            Project to make water accessible to the entire nation. As is known, Libya is in a desert
                            area and Gaddafi's arrangement to enable each resident of access was the Great Man-Made
                            River Project. <br><br><br>
                            <b>Education and Healthcare was free and accessible</b><br><br>
                            Under Gaddafi, education and medical services were free for all. A reaction to this case
                            by Masareef Edareeya, a Libyan resident asserted the nature of education and wellbeing
                            was horrifying yet that does nothing to the way that it was free. No framework is
                            wonderful except for most are flawed and still costly. Gaddafi ensured his framework was
                            financed and even Mercy Corps verified the reality in its Beyond Gaddafi: Libya's
                            Governance Context. That is more than the supposed pioneers" can say for their nations.
                            <br><br><br>
                            <b>Newlyweds received $50,000 from the government</b><br><br>
                            Gaddafi's legislature had a law accommodating a monetary award to newly-weds to purchase
                            their first apartment to help start a family. Cases are that the process was repetitive
                            and regulatory to the degree that relatively few individuals tried to finish it yet the
                            $50,000 was there if one finished. Again Mercy Corps affirmed Gaddafi gave lodging to
                            newly-weds. Reprimanding the award on grounds of repetitive cycles is an ill-motioned
                            attack at assaulting what Gaddafi represented. <br><br><br>
                            Libya had no external debt and had reserves of $150 billion most of which were frozen
                            globally <br><br>
                            Libya was indeed a booming economic center under the rule of Gaddafi.to put this in the
                            appropriate perspective, the self-acclaimed capital of democracy and capitalism had a
                            debt of 18 trillion USD, Libya had NONE. This goes to prove beyond any iota of doubt
                            that Gaddafi even though portrayed to be a murderer and dictator, had a love for his own
                            country and did all he could to keep them out of debt. <br><br>
                            With these strong and irrefutable points, let's see what is the situation of current-day
                            Libya. <br><br><br>
                            <h5>Libya is in Chaos</h5><br>
                            <img src="<?=PROOT?>assets/images/covidma4.jpg" alt="Gaddafi"
                                class="img-fluid art-img" /><br><br>
                            Today’s day Libya is simply sorrowful. Multiple tribes who were once united under the
                            “Dictator” now struggle for power and influence and authority over the nations already
                            dwindling-oil. Three different parties are in a perpetual power struggle. ISIS has taken
                            control of Sirte- Gaddafi’s hometown. <br><br>
                            When he was in power, Gaddafi did his best to give monumental facelifts to some cities
                            in the country and when he fell from power, ISIS saw the time as a ripe opportunity to
                            exploit the towns and expand their barbaric empire. It’s noteworthy that al-Qaeda tried
                            to do the same thing while Gaddafi was in control but could not succeed. <br><br><br>
                            <h5>Libya’s Black Gold</h5>
                            <img src="<?=PROOT?>assets/images/covidma5.jpg" alt="Gaddafi"
                                class="img-fluid art-img" /><br><br>
                            Libya's definitive salvation lies in its oil. This could finance the revamping of the
                            nation and spread the riches sufficiently wide with the goal that enough contending
                            groups can meet up to force a harmony. Lately, oil yield has multiplied from 250,000
                            barrels for every day to 500,000 thousand far shy of the Gaddafi-time creation levels of
                            more than 1 million barrels. <br>
                            The boost in oil sales came off the back of military action by the defense chief of the
                            former internationally recognized government, General Khalifa Haftar. He assumed
                            responsibility for key oil offices in the east. Toward the West's amazement, Libya's
                            National Oil Corporation boss positioned in Tripoli permitted Haftar and his partners to
                            sell the oil. The move makes a joke of the UN-sponsored GNA's capacity to lead the
                            nation, put it under their influence and own the oil. Haftar had wouldn't back the GNA
                            and in this improvement has outsmarted them and set further question marks against their
                            authenticity. The action by the GNA to give control of the nation's oil back into the
                            hands of these people just proves how hopeless it will be to think Libya’s oil might
                            save them someday. <br><br>
                            <h5>Power Struggle</h5>

                            If there is one thing that divides Africa apart more than anything it’s the mad hunger
                            for power by some of its citizens. This has woefully become the case in Libya. As a
                            result of the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, several groups have been in a perpetual struggle
                            for rule over the once peaceful country. Three political powers, hundreds of groups, and
                            multiple tribes are still in a struggle for control. This has resulted in tribal wars
                            that led to the loss of life and destruction. <br><br><br>

                            Recently in March, The UN hastened to form GNA (General National Congress). A government
                            that would see to it that peace is restored in the country and the struggling factions
                            are brought together. But since its formation and since its leadership arrived by boat
                            in Tripoli, it has since struggled to be relevant and has brought no change in the
                            current state of things. <br><br>
                            The two questions asked at the beginning of the article can then only be answered by the
                            reader. <b>Has Gaddafi’s death made Libya later?</b><br><br>
                            <b>Is Libya Happy now?</b>

                            2022 diversity immigrant visa program (dv-2022)' got from the US Department of States

                            The archive expresses that Nigerian residents are the main Africans that are not

                            grounds that over 50,000 locals of the nation moved to the United States in the previous
                            5 years. <br><br>
                            Different nations who fall into this class and are banished from participating they are
                            Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China (counting Hong Kong SAR), Colombia, Dominican
                            Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Pakistan,

                            Part of the announcement from the archive peruses, "For DV-2022, people conceived in the
                            accompanying nations are not qualified to apply, in light of the fact that more than,
                            50,000 locals of these nations moved to the United States in the past five years:

                            needy domains, and Vietnam. People conceived in Macau SAR and Taiwan are qualified."
                            <br><br>
                            Despite the fact that locals of other African nations are permitted to apply, the
                            archive clarified that "people conceived in the territories prior to June 1967 by

                            West Bank are chargeable to Jordan; people conceived in the Golan Heights are chargeable
                            to Syria." <br><br>

                            It expresses that candidates who are chosen in the program must meet basic yet severe
                            qualification necessities to fit the bill for a variety visa. <br><br>
                            It additionally expresses that the Department of State decides selectees through a

                            takes note of that no single nation may get over 7% of the accessible DVs in any one

                            - President Paul Kagame chaired a Cabinet meeting in which he approved regulatory
                            guidelines on cultivation, processing and export of “high-value therapeutic crops” -
                            While the country approved cannabis cultivation, use of the same for medicinal or
                            recreational purposes is still prohibited - Rwanda aims at boosting its export revenue

                            According to The New Times Rwanda, Paul Kagame's government aims at boosting its export
                            revenue by tapping into the fast growing global cannabis market which is currently
                            valued at $345 billion. <br>

                            <br> Speaking to The New Times, Aloysie Manishimwe, a researcher in medicinal plants,
                            welcomed the government’s decision to enter the multi-billion dollar industry. <br><br>
                            “I don’t think it’s a bad move since it comes to serve healthcare needs. Already there
                            are many countries that have used cannabis for medicinal purposes,” she said. <br><br>
                            Manishimwe, however, reminded authorities not to throw caution to the wind. <br><br>
                            “Already drug abuse, specifically cannabis is rampant among young people in Rwanda. The
                            task will be upon the government to have strong law enforcement,” she added. <br><br>
                            Rwanda joins the likes of other African countries including South Africa, Malawi,
                            Lesotho and Zambia to legalize the production and export of cannabis for medical
                            purposes. <br><br>
                            “The government of Rwanda expects the sector to generate significant export revenues and
                            employment opportunities in high-value agriculture and agro-processing,” RDB said.

                            <h5>The process to approve cannabis farming in Rwanda started in 2019</h5>
                            According to sources from the country, the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) had invited
                            several companies to bid for the development of medical cannabis in the country in 2019
                            with a focus on the export market only. <b>It should be noted production or sale of
                                cannabis is prohibited in Rwanda and doctors are banned from prescribing it as
                                medicine. Anyone found guilty of the aforementioned could face two years jail term
                                and a fine of about KSh 300,000 under Article 266 of the country's Penal Code.</b>

                            You may ask how Rwanda made such a great turnaround. <br>
                            It's simple, in 2008 the Rwandan ministry of environment commissioned research into how
                            plastic bags were a threat to the environment, polluted waters and killed aquatic life,
                            and polluted the society as a whole. According to the United Nations environment
                            program, after several months of study and research, a huge step was taken and there was
                            a ban on the use of single plastic bags. This was then replaced with other safer sources
                            such as the banana leaf, cloth, paper, and papyrus. <br>

                            Rome was not built overnight either was the cleanliness of Rwanda achieved overnight,
                            because of its ambitious goal to increase forest cover by 30% by 2020 per the World
                            economic forum. Due to this, the nation has undertaken a massive tree-planting program
                            and reforestation. Additionally, new measures such as agroforestry and ‘training schemes
                            in forest management were put in place together with the ban on plastic this measure has
                            helped improve upon the rise in clean cities across Rwanda. <br>

                            You never know what proper and effective planning can reap until you read about how the
                            dream to be the cleanest capital city in Africa helped Rwanda become one of the cleanest
                            countries in Africa. <br><br>
                            do you know littering in Rwanda could get you jailed? or may even make you face hefty
                            fines? now you know, the nation of Rwanda takes this very seriously. According to the
                            New York Times, this has paid off beautifully. Thanks majorly to the absence of plastic
                            waste, the UN habitat declared Kigali as one of the cleanest capitals in Africa in 2008.
                            Rwanda has gone ahead to use innovations and investments of promote this effort, so as
                            reach its full goal. <br><br><br>

                            <h5><b>New opportunities</b></h5>
                            As a cliché goes, every dark cloud has a silver lining. As Rwanda placed a ban on the
                            use of single-use plastic products, it created avenues of employment for investors who
                            were looking for new and alternative goods to plastic. They created other biodegradable
                            goods. The best part is they recycled the plastic waste into other useful items. So they
                            did not simply stop the creation of new plastic waste but were also using the already
                            existing ones in creating useful items. <br>

                            <h5><b>Umuganda</b></h5>
                            Umuganda is a local Kinyarwanda that means “coming together for a mutual purpose”. In
                            this spirit, there is a monthly cleanup exercise organized on the last Saturday of every
                            month to tidy up the society. Umuganda in itself is not a volunteer program as described
                            its rather a fun project in which people come together at the end of every month to tidy
                            up their surroundings, but notice this police monitor the activity and can stop any
                            Rwandan at any time and force them to clean up the environment right on the spot. There
                            are hefty penalties for any Rwandan who does not take part in the activity. This is 5000
                            francs that is almost 9.06 dollars. This might not seem much but note that the average
                            Rwandan earns roughly 150 dollars monthly. <br>

                            countries on Earth. In any case, in all honesty, the nation is currently going to the
                            individuals who attempted to destroy the wildlife. Eco-Age reports that "reformed
                            poachers currently secure the imperiled mountain gorillas and different warm-blooded
                            creatures which they used to chase." Other ex-poachers are presently beneficially
                            utilized as doormen and aides, securely bringing vacationers into the wild to see the
                            gorillas. <br>

                            Since no sort of nation-wide effort can be supported without a noteworthy difference in
                            mentality, it has been fundamental for Rwanda to put the climate and environmental
                            change worries at the core of its turn of events. This has taken care of as of now, as
                            Rwanda's Ministry of Natural Resources was as of late authorized by the International
                            Green Climate Fund. The World Economic Forum says this assignment will assist the nation
                            to draw in an important new account with helping control environmental change, "enough
                            to empower it to keep up quick monetary development on an asset productive, low-carbon,
                            and atmosphere versatile way." Countries need to roll out some large improvements to
                            support the climate too.

                            The event of the spread of the coronavirus has led to the imposition of lockdowns in
                            most countries. This has brought about a halt in travel and tourism. Due to the help of

                            death caused by the virus are now decreasing and hence bringing about easing of the
                            restrictions and lockdown. <br>
                             There is hope that in the not-so-distant future bans on traveling will be lifted and we

                                    is frequently viewed as the best safari objective in Africa since it observes a

                            It all started in Col. Rindam of the Nigerian Army was killed by police at a checkpoint
                            in Lagos in 1992. When the information reached the army, soldiers were deployed to
                            capture any police officer in the city. The Nigerian police officers then fled out of
                            towns abandoning their posts, checkpoints and security areas, and other points of
                            interest for criminals. Some even resigned from the police force for fear of their
                            lives. This occurrence led to a high surge in the rate of crime. Later that year former
                            Police commissioner Simeon Danladi Midenda formed the SPECIAL ANTI-ROBBERY SQUAD (SARS)
                            to combat robbery, motor vehicle theft, kidnapping, cattle rustling, and crimes
                            involving firearms. They were originally fifteen (15) police officers who were operating
                            in the shadows under the government till they were later officially commissioned in
                            Lagos after the dispute between the police and the Soldiers were settled. <br><br>
                            Little did the innocent Nigerians know that this would become the birth of “the licensed
                            killing squad” <br><br><br>
                            <h5><b>The beginning of the troubles </b></h5>
                            In mid-1996, the Lagos branch of SARS captured two safety officers at their work for
                            being suspected to have helped in a burglary. The two watchmen were not officially
                            charged with wrongdoing while captured. In January 1997, the groups of the watchmen were
                            set at a funeral home without clarification for their demises. <br><br>
                            In 2009, quite a while after the first incident the crew became stronger. Because of the
                            flood of web-fraudsters and cultism in colleges, SARS agents penetrated Nigerian
                            colleges, made a few fruitful captures however in the process harmed blameless young
                            people. As per a publication by Pulse.ng a Nigerian news site, "What SARS became was a
                            national scourge that witch-hunt machinery against Nigerian youth with dreadlocks,
                            piercings, cars, expensive phones and risk means of expression”. <br><br>
                            In May 2010, Amnesty International unveiled that it would be suing the Nigerian Police
                            over denial of basic freedoms expressing that the Special Anti-Robbery Squad in
                            Borokiri, Port Harcourt captured three bicycle riders and confined them for more than a
                            week while being "beaten each night with the knob of a weapon and iron belt."[9] On 20
                            May 2010, a Federal High Court in Enugu State, requested the then IGP Ogbonna Okechukwu
                            Onovo to deliver a Special Anti-Robbery Squad official who had gunned down a 15 years of
                            age kid in secondary school. As per the SARS official, the adolescent was confused with
                            a kidnapper.[10] On 27 July 2010, a broad publication report was distributed by Sahara
                            Reporters on how SARS among other police units benefit 9.35 Billion Naira ($60 million)
                            from detours and coercion within 18 months. <br><br><br>

                            Following several reports on the inhumane treatment of citizens by SARS officials, the
                            then IGP Solomon Arase announced it would be splitting SARS into two units operational
                            unit and investigative units to curb the infringements of the force on human rights.

                            <h5><b>The Second Wave</b></h5>
                            A September 2016 report published by Amnesty International revealed broad torment and
                            confinement of people without being tried. The report revealed that SARS had been
                            coercing people into involuntarily admitting to criminal offenses, starving people, and
                            several other cases of abuse. <br><br>
                            On 10 August 2019, while SARS agents were on an attack in Ijegun to capture ruffians in
                            the region, agents of the unit discharged a few shots in an offer to quell the hijackers
                            and throughout the activity, a stray bullet hit a pregnant lady, she passed on the spot.
                            A furious mob was said to have lynched two cops on the spot. <br><br>
                            On 21 August 2019, four SARS agents were captured and accused of homicide in the wake of
                            being caught on video mauling and afterward shooting to death two presumed telephone
                            hoodlums in wide daylight. The two speculated telephone thieves were shot dead after
                            they had been arrested. <br><br>
                            On 5 September 2019, agents of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad in Lekki, Lagos supposedly
                            hijacked, tormented, and burglarized Nigerian rapper Ikechukwu Onunaku. As per reports
                            by Punch Nigeria, the rapper had to make a few withdrawals at the ATM to pay SARS agents
                            for sitting idle. <br><br><br>
                            <h5><b>The beginning of the end</b></h5>
                            On Saturday 3 October 2020, a video began moving via social media indicating a SARS
                            police shoot a youthful Nigerian before Wetland Hotel, Ughelli, Delta State. It was
                            claimed that the SARS police then took away the youngster's vehicle - a Lexus SUV. The
                            viral video caused public clamor via web-based media, particularly on Twitter, with the
                            #ENDSARS hashtag trending. <br><br><br>
                            <h5><b>Enough is enough</b></h5>

                            After the widespread of the gruesome video of the murder of the young man by the SARS
                            operatives, people took to the streets to protest and call an end to the force. <br><br>
                            On 11th October 2020, the protestors met the government with five ultimatums. They were
                            first, the immediate release of all arrested during the protests as well as justice and
                            compensation for all who died through police brutality in Nigeria. They also demanded
                            that an independent body be set up within 10 days to investigate and prosecute all
                            reports of police misconduct. The protestors also asked for psychological evaluation and
                            retraining of SARS operatives before they are deployed to any other police unit. Lastly,
                            they asked for adequate remuneration for Nigerian police. <br><br>
                            In response to the public objection to the police brutality, the Inspector-General of
                            Nigeria Police restricted the FSARS, Special Tactical Squad (STS), Intelligence Response
                            Team (IRT), Anti-Cultism Squad, and other strategic units from mounting of barriers,
                            checkpoints, stop and search and other daily schedule and watches yet they have done
                            likewise for more than four times in four distinct years making Citizens of Nigeria
                            question their activities. <br><br><br>
                            <h5><b>The End?</b></h5>
                            On Sunday, 11 October 2020, Nigeria's Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu
                            declared the "dissolution" of SARS. Numerous Nigerians inside the development
                            scrutinized the declaration, in any case, bringing up that comparative guarantees had
                            been made in before years and that the administration arranged to reassign SARS
                            officials to other police offices instead to dispense them from the power entirely.
                            <br><br>
                            The protests proceeded notwithstanding the "disintegration" the same number of do not
                            believe the announcement. On Tuesday, 13 October 2020, an official statement marked by
                            Femi Adesina the Presidential representative, shows that the Nigerian Government has
                            accepted to the five requests of the End SARS protestors. <br><br>
                            Because of previous occurrences where such announcements were made and later were not
                            stuck too, people do not believe the cruelty of the infamous SARS is over. If it is
                            truly over or not, we live to see. <br>
